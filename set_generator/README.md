# 3DZwei Set Generator

With this you can generate your own Card and Character Spritesheets for 3DZwei.

The theoretically maximum of cardset cards would be 345, because `1024/55 * 1024/55 --> 346.636694215` and one card is needed as the `back / empty` one.

Just edit the PNG graphics from `gfx/cards/` and `gfx/chars/` and then run `make` or double click `compile.bat` to compile the Spritesheet.

The cards must be 55x55! The Characters must be 120x120!

**You need devkitARM & Tex3ds to compile this.**
