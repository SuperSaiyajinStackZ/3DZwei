# 3DZwei Card Generator

With this you can generate your own Card Spritesheet for 3DZwei.

The theoretically maximum of pairs would be 345, because `1024/55 * 1024/55 --> 346.636694215` and one card is needed as the "back / empty" one.

Just edit the png graphics from `gfx/cards/` and then run "make" to compile the Spritesheet.

The cards must be 55x55!!

**You need devkitARM & Tex3ds to compile this!**
